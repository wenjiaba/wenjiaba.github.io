About Me
======

I am a PhD student from Stanford Graduate School of Business, co-advised by [Prof. Haim Mendelson](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/haim-mendelson) and [Prof. Michael Harrison](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/faculty/j-michael-harrison).
My research focuses on understanding sequential interactions using both the data-driven algorithmic approach and the modeling approach. In my research, I apply machine learning, revenue management, and probability theory to applications such as online advertising, games, and emerging platforms like virtual assistants.

Previously, I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Fudan University in 2016.
